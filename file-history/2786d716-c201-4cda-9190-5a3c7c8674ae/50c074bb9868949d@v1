## Key Differences from Standard Spring

| What You Know | finhq-verse Does Instead |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Spring Security | Custom `Passport` via thread-local |
| `JpaRepository` | Custom `Repository<T>` with mandatory scoping |
| `Pageable` (offset) | `CursorPageRequest` (cursor-based) |
| Single DataSource | Dual DataSource (LIVE/SANDBOX routing) |
| UUID | ULID (time-sortable) |
| Hand-written controllers | OpenAPI-generated `*ApiDelegate` |

## Essential Files to Read

| Priority | File | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| 1 | `README_LLM.md` | Complete conventions guide |
| 2 | `Passport.java` | Multi-tenancy context carrier |
| 3 | `Repository.java` | Custom data access interface |
| 4 | `AbstractService.java` | Service layer template |
| 5 | `OrganizationService.java` | Concrete example |
