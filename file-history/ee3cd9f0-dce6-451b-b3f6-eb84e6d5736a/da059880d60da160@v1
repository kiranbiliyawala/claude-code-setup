# MPO PR Reviews - Archana Badagi

## Note on MPO Repository Access

The MPO repository could not be located during the review process. The following PRs were listed for review but could not be accessed:

### PR #190 - PPI Authentication Support
**Status:** Unable to review (repository not accessible)

### PR #196 - PPI Debit Call Error Message Handling
**Status:** Unable to review (repository not accessible)

## Recommendation

To complete the full review, please verify:
1. The correct repository name for MPO (possible names: `mpo`, `merchant-payment-operations`, `ppi`)
2. Repository access permissions

Based on the PR descriptions, these appear to be related to PPI (Prepaid Payment Instrument) functionality, which would add valuable context to Archana's payment domain expertise evaluation.
